# OpenShift Pipelines Examples

## Why Use OpenShift Pipelines?

OpenShift Pipelines is a Kubernetes-native serverless CI/CD platform based on the upstream [Tekton](https://tekton.dev) project.

Simply by installing the [OpenShift Pipelines Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cicd/pipelines/installing-pipelines.html) in your OpenShift 4.6+ cluster, you will have a powerful Continuous Integration system available to you without the need to run and maintain a CI server!

*Pipelines* and *Tasks* are represented as YAML files and *Steps* are executed by container images.  This means that your pipelines are portable across any OpenShift environment in and datacentre or cloud, provided you have access to the git repository where your pipelines are stored and the image repository that contains the task steps.
